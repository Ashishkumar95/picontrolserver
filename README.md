# picontrolserver
A small http server to manage raspberry pi's camera and other daemons for UAV

prerequistes:
1. RPI updated to jessie rasbian. As this daemon uses this library https://github.com/vinipsmaker/tufao that needs 
   c++11 that needs gcc2.9 and Qt5. I have seen links that shows how to install gcc2.9 on current rasbian. I will update once I get hold of such links.


# usage requries a client on the phone or computer. I would like to integrate it with qgroundcontrol when I find time.
